Data directory for pixel-based processing.

The following subdirectories should be created (will be written into during processing):

* `climate`
* `soil`
* `terrain`
* `timeseries`
* `predictions`
* `biomes` (optional, to store VITO biome data, not used in the end)

The directory `raw-points` should contain training and validation data (not included as it's licensed from IIASA and WUR). The rest are generated by the processing scripts. Some data is taken from the PROBA-V MEP/Terrascope (ASTER and PROBA-V data). `DataDirs-NG.csv` lists the actual PROBA-V imagery used. `raw-points/global-point-grid-02deg.csv` is a list of points on the 0.2 degree grid globally.
