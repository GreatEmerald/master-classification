Data included in the repository are:

- `groundtruth.sqlite`: SpatiaLite database containing gathered ground truth data. Points contain the actual proportions of land cover in a pixel, and polygons were used to measure them.
- `groundtruth.csv`: Points from the above converted into CSV format in QGIS.
- `variables.csv`: The above CSV file with data from all covariated merged into it. This is the file that gets sourced during main processing.
- `timing.csv`: Timing statistics of the full-tile prediction step. These are written manually by copying the timing statistics from the `system.time()` output so as not to conflict between different methods' prediction steps.
- `aoi.*`: Boundary shapefile of area of interest (PROBA-V tile X20Y01).
- `probavgrid.*`: Boundary shapefile of each pixel in the PROBA-V tile of interest.
- `$1-stat-$2-$3.csv`: Calculated error statistics by the scripts in the classification directory, used only for visualisation in graphs (`plot-errors.r`). `$1` is an optional "errors" (if present, individual errors have been calculated; if not present, per-class errors have been calculated); `$2` is the classification method used (one of: "dummy", "cmeans", "neuralnetworks", "gradientboost", "randomforest"), `$3` is an optional modifier (one of: "unoptimised" for unoptimised models; "pure" for models trained on endmember pixels and validated on mixed pixels; "pure-unoptimised" for a combination of both).

Data used but not included in the repository:

- PROBA-V Collection 1 imagery in GeoTIFF format (100m TOC 5-day composites). It is publicly available from the [PROBA-V website](http://www.vito-eodata.be/PDF/portal/Application.html), but the scripts are made to work on the PROBA-V Mission Exploitation Platform, which includes all this data in the `/data/MTDA/TIFFDERIVED` directory.
- EU-DEM: publicly available from the [European Environment Agency website](http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eu-dem).
- GLSDEM: publicly available from the [Global Land Survey website](http://glcf.umd.edu/data/glsdem/).
- ESA LC-CCI hard classification: publicly available from the [European Space Agency website](http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download.php).
- Intermediate data files generated by the scripts, such as NDVI files cleaned of clouds. They are large and automated using scripts.
